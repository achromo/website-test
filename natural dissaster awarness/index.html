          <h1>A Wildfire</h1>
          <p>
            A wildfire, forest fire, or a bushfire is an unplanned and
            uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation. Some natural
            forest ecosystems depend on wildfire. Modern forest management often
            engages in prescribed burns to mitigate fire risk and promote
            natural forest cycles. However, controlled burns can turn into
            wildfires by mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wildfires can be classified by cause of ignition, physical
            properties, combustible material present, and the effect of weather
            on the fire. Climatic cycles with wet periods that create
            substantial fuels, followed by drought and heat, often precede
            severe wildfires.

          <h1>Spreading</h1>
          <p>
            The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material
            present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather
            conditions.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ground fires</strong> burn roots and buried organic
              matter, smoldering for days or months.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Crawling/Surface fires</strong> burn leaf litter and low
              shrubs, spreading more slowly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ladder fires</strong> climb small trees and vines to reach
              canopies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Crown fires</strong> burn the canopy itself, driven by
              strong winds and dry conditions.

          <h1>Suppression</h1>
          <p>
            Wildfire suppression refers to all the efforts made to stop or
            contain a wildfire once it has started. Firefighters, helicopters,
            airplanes, and specialized equipment are often used to prevent the
            fire from spreading and to protect people, property, and natural
            resources.
          </p>

          <h2>Common Suppression Techniques</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Firelines:</strong> Clearing strips of vegetation to
              remove fuel so the fire can’t cross.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backburning:</strong> Intentionally setting small
              controlled fires ahead of the main blaze to remove fuel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Water and Retardants:</strong> Dropping water or
              fire-retardant chemicals from helicopters or airplanes to slow the
              fire’s spread.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ground Crews:</strong> Firefighters on the ground use
              hoses, bulldozers, and hand tools to control the fire’s edges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitoring Hotspots:</strong> After a wildfire is
              contained, teams watch for hidden embers or reignition.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Challenges in Suppression</h2>
          <p>
            Suppressing wildfires is dangerous and complex. Weather conditions
            like wind, heat, and low humidity can cause sudden flare-ups. Remote
            terrain makes it difficult to access burning areas, and climate
            change is increasing both the intensity and frequency of fires
            worldwide.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of these challenges, modern strategies focus not only on
            suppression but also on prevention — through forest management,
            community awareness, and early detection systems.

      <h1>What to Prepare</h1>
      <p>
        Preparation is the most effective way to stay safe during wildfire season. 
        Having the right supplies, plans, and knowledge can save lives and reduce damage. 
        Every household should create a wildfire readiness plan that includes emergency kits, 
        communication strategies, and ways to protect your property.
      </p>

      <h2>Emergency Supply Kit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> At least 3 liters per person per day for 3 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-perishable food:</strong> Canned or dry goods that can last several days.</li>
        <li><strong>First aid kit:</strong> Include necessary medications and bandages.</li>
        <li><strong>Face masks or respirators:</strong> To protect against smoke inhalation.</li>
        <li><strong>Flashlight and batteries:</strong> Power outages are common during wildfires.</li>
        <li><strong>Important documents:</strong> IDs, insurance papers, stored in waterproof bags.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Evacuation and Communication</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Evacuation plan:</strong> Know at least two escape routes from your area.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency contacts:</strong> Keep a list of phone numbers written down, not just on your phone.</li>

        <li><strong>Vehicle readiness:</strong> Keep your car fueled and emergency bag ready to go.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Home Protection Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear dry leaves, pine needles, and flammable debris from around your home.</li>
        <li>Use fire-resistant materials for roofs and fences where possible.</li>
        <li>Trim tree branches at least 10 feet away from buildings.</li>
        <li>Keep garden hoses connected and accessible.</li>

      <h1>How to Survive a Wildfire</h1>
      <p>
        When a wildfire threatens your area, quick thinking and calm actions can make the difference 
        between safety and danger. Follow these steps to protect yourself, your family, and your pets 
        during an active wildfire.
      </p>

      <h2>Before You Evacuate</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay tuned to local alerts, radio, or official apps for evacuation orders.</li>
        <li>Prepare your emergency kit and load it into your vehicle.</li>
        <li>Wear protective clothing — long sleeves, sturdy shoes, and a face covering.</li>
        <li>Turn off gas, propane, and electricity if instructed to do so.</li>
        <li>Close all windows, vents, and doors to prevent sparks from entering your home.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If a Wildfire Is Near</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep calm and leave early if possible. Do not wait until you can see flames.</li>
        <li>Follow your community’s evacuation routes — never take shortcuts through unknown terrain.</li>
        <li>Drive with headlights on and watch for emergency crews or fallen debris.</li>
        <li>Keep doors unlocked for quick exit if conditions worsen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If You’re Trapped</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a clear area free of vegetation — like a road, dirt area, or water body.</li>
        <li>Lie face down and cover yourself with soil, wet cloth, or blanket to protect from heat.</li>
        <li>Breathe through a damp cloth to reduce smoke inhalation.</li>
        <li>Call emergency services if you can, and signal for help.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After the Fire</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wait until authorities declare the area safe before returning home.</li>
        <li>Watch for hidden embers, fallen power lines, and weak structures.</li>
        <li>Photograph any damage for insurance purposes before cleanup.</li>
        <li>Check on neighbors, pets, and community members who may need assistance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Survival depends on preparation, awareness, and staying calm under pressure. 
        Wildfires move fast — but so can you when you know what to do.
